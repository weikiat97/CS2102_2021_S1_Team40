CS2102 Database Systems: Introduction to Web Application Development

## Setup Locally

1. Make sure you have node and npm installed. Quickest way is to use homebrew and do `brew install node`.
2. `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Create a local instance of postgreSQL database.
   1. Make sure you have postgres installed. `brew install postgresql`.
   2. Start postgres server. `brew services start postgresql`.
   3. Create a database. `createdb <dbname>`
   4. Load the build schema. `psql -d <dbname> < build-schema.sql`
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and specify the `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` like this: `DB_CONNECTION_STRING="postgresql://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@localhost:5432/<dbname>"`.
5. `npm start`. This should run the api on port 3000 by default.

Tips:

1. You can do `psql -d <dbname>` to enter into your database cmd and execute SQL queries directly there.
2. In your database cmd after you do step 1, you can do `\l` to see all your databases and `\d` to see all your tables.

## Lint checking with Prettier

Run `npx prettier --write .` in project root to auto format all your code nicely!
